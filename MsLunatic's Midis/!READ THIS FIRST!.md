Its me! MsLunatic!

I make midis sometimes and this is where they are

Quick thing to note, some of these midis will have slide notes, they are located in their own midi channel, some of them are necessary for the cover to sound good, if you dont have access to slide notes in you DAW, idk get a better one ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

With all that out of the way, credit me when using my midis
